First, if you have been a researcher at Academia Sinica for more than one year, and you have performed exceptionally well, made important contributions, and domestic and foreign academic circles recognize your value, then you have the opportunity to become a distinguished researcher.

In the second case, if you have been a professor in a research institution or university at home and abroad recognized by Academia Sinica for more than one year, and you have made significant academic contributions and achievements, and have been recognized by academic circles at home and abroad, then you may also be selected as a distinguished researcher.

Finally, if you are an academician of Academia Sinica, then you can also become a distinguished researcher.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion_oneLeft" href="#collapseFiveLeft-139" aria-expanded="false" class="collapsed">[Relevant regulations on the new recruitment, re-appointment and promotion of researchers] I have been a professor at a public university for one year, can I apply for a researcher position at Academia Sinica?</a></h4></div><div id="collapseFiveLeft-139" class="panel-collapse collapse" aria-expanded="false" role="tablist" style="height: 0px;"><div class="panel-body"><div class="text-accordion"><p>Yes, as long as you have made important academic contributions, you are eligible for appointment as a researcher at the Central Academy of Sciences.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion_oneLeft" href="#collapseFiveLeft-140" aria-expanded="false" class="collapsed">[Relevant regulations on the new recruitment, re-appointment and promotion of researchers] Can I apply to be an associate researcher if I have been working as an assistant researcher at Academia Sinica for one year?</a></h4></div><div id="collapseFiveLeft-140" class="panel-collapse collapse" aria-expanded="false" role="tablist" style="height: 0px;"><div class="panel-body"><div class="text-accordion"><p>Yes, as long as you have made important academic achievements during the year, you are eligible to apply to be an associate research fellow.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion_oneLeft" href="#collapseFiveLeft-141" aria-expanded="false" class="collapsed">[Relevant regulations on the new recruitment, re-appointment and promotion of researchers] Does the qualification of a research assistant only require academic qualifications, or does it also require other experience accumulation?</a></h4></div><div id="collapseFiveLeft-141" class="panel-collapse collapse" aria-expanded="false" role="tablist" style="height: 0px;"><div class="panel-body"><div class="text-accordion"><p>Qualifications for research assistants not only require academic qualifications, but also some experience.
