Once they get in touch with us and have actual needs, we may sign a confidentiality contract or material transfer contract with them and submit a ""Negotiation Summary Form"".

The first is the preliminary review. First discuss it with the creator or his representative and his unit, and respond within one month after getting their opinions. It then takes another seven working days to complete the initial evaluation.

Then there is the re-evaluation, which means that the director of the Intellectual Property Division will complete the re-evaluation in seven working days based on the results of the initial evaluation. Once the results are available, the creator or his representative will be notified.

If you decide to continue maintenance, just do it. If maintenance is no longer required, an announcement will be made on the website of the Intellectual Property Office to let everyone know. This announcement period is three months.

After the announcement period, the matter of whether to give up or give up maintenance will be discussed by the research and management meeting.

In addition, if Academia Sinica is the patentee but other units share the patent fees, it will decide not to continue maintenance after the initial evaluation and re-evaluation, and will notify other units of the matter first. If they are willing to take over, they can go directly to the Research and Management Committee for review without making an announcement.

Finally, if Academia Sinica and other units jointly own the patent rights, then operate according to the contract or agreement. If it is not specified how to do it, ask other units in writing whether they want to continue maintenance. Then follow the initial evaluation and re-evaluation procedures mentioned above. If maintenance is not continued, it will be directly submitted to the Research and Management Committee for review.

If other units are academic research institutions or governments, then decide not to continue maintenance after the initial evaluation and re-evaluation, and make an announcement with their written consent, and then go to the Research and Management Committee to discuss how to handle it.

If when Academia Sinica announces the transfer of patent rights, other units are willing to take over, and follow-up procedures will be handled in accordance with relevant regulations of Academia Sinica."
