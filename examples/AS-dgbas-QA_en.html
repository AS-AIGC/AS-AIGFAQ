According to the main points of domestic business trip travel expense reporting, each agency can formulate reimbursement regulations within this scope based on business characteristics or other factors, such as the calculation basis based on the number of kilometers, hours, or business trip location. The regulations about being more than 60 kilometers away from the location of the agency are actually aimed at the requirements for the payment of accommodation expenses, not the restrictions on the reporting of miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, when reporting miscellaneous expenses, all agencies should follow the relevant regulations set by them, or report expenses according to the daily standard.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion_oneLeft" href="#collapseFiveLeft-171" aria-expanded="false" class="collapsed">[Compilation of Interpretations by the Executive Yuan] What matters should the HR Office be responsible for confirming when reviewing the domestic travel expense report form?</a></h4></div><div id="collapseFiveLeft-171" class="panel-collapse collapse" aria-expanded="false" role="tablist" style="height: 0px;"><div class="panel-body"><div class="text-accordion"><p>When reviewing the domestic travel expense report form, the personnel office needs to be responsible for confirming the following items: 1.
