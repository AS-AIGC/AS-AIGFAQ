320,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,What is the principle of X-ray diffractometer?,the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,"The principle of X-ray diffractometer is to use accelerated electrons to impact metal targets to generate X-rays, and then analyze samples with periodic lattice structures. By collecting the diffraction angles of different crystal planes, the lattice parameters of the sample can be analyzed, and by analyzing the diffraction intensity of each crystal plane, information on the type and position of atoms in the lattice structure can be obtained. So the combined diffraction pattern of each crystal is unique and, like a human fingerprint, can be used to identify a material as a mineral crystal or as a crystalline material."
321,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,There are several X-ray diffractometers in this laboratory. How are their functions different?,the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,"There are three different types of X-ray diffractometers in this laboratory. The first one is X-ray room temperature diffractometer, which is used for X-ray diffraction analysis at room temperature; the second one is X-ray variable temperature diffractometer, which has the function of changing temperature. , can conduct research on temperature dependence; the third is a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer, which can provide wide-angle and low-grazing angle diffraction analysis, and is specially used to analyze the microstructure of thin films."
322,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,What safety education and machine operation training are required before using the X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory?,the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,"Before using the X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory, users need to receive relevant safety education and machine operation training, and only after passing the examination can they obtain the authority to use the facilities and instruments independently."
323,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,Which sample characteristics analysis services can this laboratory provide?,the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,"This laboratory can provide analysis services for the characteristics of sample crystal phase, material structure, material internal strain, material residual stress and material crystallinity."
324,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,What is the difference between X-ray variable temperature diffractometer and X-ray room temperature diffractometer?,the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,"The main difference between X-ray variable temperature diffractometer and X-ray room temperature diffractometer is the temperature function. The X-ray variable temperature diffractometer has the function of changing temperature and can conduct temperature-dependent research, while the X-ray normal temperature diffractometer is only used for X-ray diffraction analysis at normal temperature."
325,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,What kind of samples are high-resolution X-ray diffractometers suitable for analyzing?,the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,High-resolution X-ray diffractometer is suitable for analyzing samples with thin film microstructure.
326,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,Where is the X-ray Diffraction Materials Analysis Laboratory and who runs it?,the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,"The X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory is located in the B1A laboratory on the first floor of the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, and is managed by Ou Minnan, a research assistant."
327,Hospital-wide core facilities,X-ray diffraction material analysis laboratory,". Where should I go to inquire about the rules of use, charging standards and contact information of the X-ray Diffraction Material Analysis Laboratory?",the academic,https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/,Academia Sinica Academic Office,"To inquire about the rules of use, charging standards and contact information of the X-ray Diffraction Materials Analysis Laboratory, you can refer to this website: https://www.phys.sinica.edu.tw/~XRDCF/."
