It can use microarray technology to array hundreds or thousands of tiny probes on a chip, and use laser light to excite the probes to emit fluorescent signals. By analyzing these signals, multiple molecules can be detected simultaneously. This technology can greatly improve the speed and sensitivity of analysis, and can detect minute changes at the same time."
